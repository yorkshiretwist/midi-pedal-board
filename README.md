# MIDI Pedal Board

I have an idea to build a MIDI pedal board for sending MIDI messages to a laptop while I'm playing guitar. It could send note messages (to trigger samples), or program changes (to change effects) or many combinations.

Videos like [this by Hacker Shack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M25I58I7BtI) and [this by Notes and Volts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3WevrsmO9o) make it look easy - well, at least not crazy difficult. And parts are both easy to obtain and cheap.

Specialised parts, like [this sloped aluminuim enclosure](https://uk.farnell.com/bopla/atph-1865-300/case-aluminium-68x300x181mm/dp/1843600), could give the unit a real professional finish. And by adding [a TFT touchscreen](https://www.pjrc.com/store/display_ili9341_touch.html) I could build something really powerful - and completely bespoke to me.

Easy, right?

The physical build will be challenging - I'm not a great craftsman - but I'm pretty sure I can handle the programming part. And that's what this project is about: a way to test the logic I want to build in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
